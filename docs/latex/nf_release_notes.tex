Release notes file for the netcdf-\/fortran package.

This file contains a high-\/level description of this package\textquotesingle{}s evolution. Entries are in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

\subsection*{4.\+4.\+4 Released May 13, 2016}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Corrected an issue where cmake-\/based builds specifying {\ttfamily U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+L\+O\+G\+G\+I\+NG} were not seeing expected behavior. The issue was reported, and subsequently fixed, by Neil Carlson at Los Alamos Nat\textquotesingle{}l Laboratory. See \href{https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/pull/44}{\tt Github Pull Request \#44} for more information.
\item Integrated improvements provided by Richard Weed. For a {\itshape complete} list of modifications, see the file {\ttfamily docs/netcdf\+\_\+fortran\+\_\+4.\+4.\+2dev\+\_\+notes\+\_\+\+R\+W.\+pdf}. {\bfseries It is highly detailed and worth reading!}

The highlights of the improvements are as follows\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Explicit dependencies on {\ttfamily N\+C\+\_\+\+M\+A\+X\+\_\+\+D\+IM} constant for arrays has been removed and replaced with dynamically-\/allocated arrays.
\item Support for {\ttfamily nc\+\_\+open\+\_\+mem()} in the C library, allowing for the creation of \char`\"{}in memory\char`\"{} files.
\item General clean up.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+4.\+3 Released 2016-\/01-\/20}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Corrected a bug which would return a false-\/positive in {\ttfamily nf\+\_\+test} when using net\+C\+D\+F-\/C {\ttfamily 4.\+4.\+0}.
\item Updated the {\ttfamily cfortran.\+doc} license document for the {\ttfamily cfortran.\+h} library. The most recent version was pulled from \href{http://cfortran.sourceforge.net}{\tt http\+://cfortran.\+sourceforge.\+net}. The previous version did not reflect that the author had released cfortran under the L\+G\+PL. See \href{https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/issues/27}{\tt Github Issue 27} for more information.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+4.\+2 Released 2015-\/02-\/02}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added infrastructure to support the new {\ttfamily netcdf-\/c} option, {\ttfamily E\+N\+A\+B\+L\+E\+\_\+\+R\+E\+M\+O\+T\+E\+\_\+\+F\+O\+R\+T\+R\+A\+N\+\_\+\+B\+O\+O\+T\+S\+T\+R\+AP}.
\item Incorporated changes submitted by Nico Schlomer which extends the cmake compatibility between {\ttfamily netcdf-\/c} and {\ttfamily netcdf-\/fortran}.
\item Incorporated a patch submitted by Thomas Jahns which fixed {\ttfamily FC} being unconditionally overwritten by {\ttfamily F77} when {\ttfamily Fortran 90} was disabled.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+4.\+1 Released 2014-\/09-\/09}


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{4.\+4.\+1-\/\+R\+C1 Released 2014-\/08-\/05}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a new variable for cmake-\/based builds, {\ttfamily N\+C\+\_\+\+E\+X\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+D\+E\+PS}. Use this to specify additional dependencies when linking against a static {\ttfamily netcdf-\/c} library, e.\+g.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
netcdf-fortran/build$ cmake .. -dnc\_extra\_deps=\textcolor{stringliteral}{"-lhdf5 -lhdf5\_hl -lcurl"}
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{4.\+4 Released 2014-\/07-\/08}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For 32-\/bit platforms fixed integer fill parameters, initialized potentially unitialized variables, and provided some missing defaults (R. Weed).
\item Fixed C\+Make builds on 32-\/bit platforms.
\item Added new {\ttfamily inq\+\_\+path} and {\ttfamily rename\+\_\+grps} functions analogous to corresponding C functions. Added associated tests (R. Weed).

\item Fixed potential bug in attribute functions for integer values when Fortran {\ttfamily I\+N\+T\+E\+G\+E\+R$\ast$1} or {\ttfamily I\+N\+T\+E\+G\+E\+R$\ast$2} types are the same size as C long (R. Weed).
\item Added test for compiler support of Fortran 2008 {\ttfamily I\+S\+O\+\_\+\+F\+O\+R\+T\+R\+A\+N\+\_\+\+E\+NV} additions and T\+S29113 standard extension.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily C\+\_\+\+P\+T\+R\+\_\+\+D\+I\+F\+F\+\_\+T} issue reported by Orion Poplowski (R. Weed).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{4.\+4-\/rc1 Released 2013-\/10-\/06}


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{4.\+4-\/beta5 Released 2013-\/08-\/27}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added configuration files to github distribution.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{4.\+4-\/beta4}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Moved to Git\+Hub from Subversion, the location of the new Git\+Hub repository is at\+: \href{http://github.com/Unidata/netCDF-Fortran}{\tt http\+://github.\+com/\+Unidata/net\+C\+D\+F-\/\+Fortran}
\item Parallel-\/build portability fixes, particularly for Open\+M\+PI and gcc/gfortran-\/4.\+8.\+x on the Mac. Also added test from Reto St√∂ckli for N\+C\+F-\/250 bug, demonstrating it was fixed in previous commit.
\item Add support for N\+F\+\_\+\+M\+P\+I\+IO, N\+F\+\_\+\+M\+P\+I\+P\+O\+S\+IX, N\+F\+\_\+\+P\+N\+E\+T\+C\+DF, and N\+F\+\_\+\+F\+I\+L\+L\+\_\+\+U\+I\+NT in the data files.
\item Add support for nf\+\_\+inq\+\_\+path.
\item Add a pre-\/processor macro that can be used to bypass the home-\/brew C\+\_\+\+P\+T\+R\+D\+I\+F\+F\+\_\+T definition and use the standard one for compilers that support it.
\item Fix a potential bug in nf\+\_\+attio to call the \+\_\+long version of some puts/gets instead of the \+\_\+int version. These were inside I\+N\+T1\+\_\+\+I\+S\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+L\+O\+NG and I\+N\+T2\+\_\+\+I\+S\+\_\+\+C\+\_\+\+L\+O\+NG ifdef blocks so they would have only showed up when those macros were true.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{4.\+4-\/beta3 Released 2012-\/12-\/07}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed bug that \char`\"{}make -\/j check\char`\"{} fails, but \char`\"{}make check\char`\"{} works fine.
\item Fixed build problems resulting from syncing with separate C distribution.
\item Synchronize with all changes made to version 4.\+2 since ts release.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{4.\+4-\/beta2 Released 2012-\/06-\/29}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Made handling of --disable-\/f03 more transparent.
\item Fixed adding flags for parallel I/O for M\+PI from David Warren.
\item Removed all the old C code that\textquotesingle{}s not needed for this separate distribution.
\item Inadvertently broke the build until syncing with C distribution in later beta release.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{4.\+4-\/beta1 Released 2012-\/03-\/02}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Fortran 2003 Support}

Version 4.\+4 is the first release to support fortran 2003 and to use the I\+SO C Bindings available in fortran 2003 to replace the older C code wrappers.

Congratulations and thanks to Richard Weed at Mississippi State University, who is the author of new code.

See the file {\ttfamily R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E\+\_\+\+F03\+\_\+\+M\+O\+DS} for a more complete description of the changes. Many changes to the build structure have been made at the same time as the new 2003 code has been inserted.

As part of the fortran 2003 refactor, the directory structure has been significantly modified. All the previous F90 C wrapper code has been moved to the \char`\"{}libsrc\char`\"{} directory.

All of the fortran code has been moved to the \char`\"{}fortran\char`\"{} directory. The directories names F77 and F90 have been removed. The most important consequence of this refactor is that pure Fortran77 compilers are no longer supported. It is assumed that the compiler supports at least Fortran 90 and also Fortran 77. If it also supports the I\+SO C Bindings, then the new 2003 code is used instead of the older C wrappers.
