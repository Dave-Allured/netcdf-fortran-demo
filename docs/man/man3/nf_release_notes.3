.IP "\(bu" 2
Corrected an issue where cmake-based builds specifying \fCUSE_LOGGING\fP were not seeing expected behavior\&. The issue was reported, and subsequently fixed, by Neil Carlson at Los Alamos Nat'l Laboratory\&. See \fCGithub Pull Request #44\fP for more information\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Integrated improvements provided by Richard Weed\&. For a \fIcomplete\fP list of modifications, see the file \fCdocs/netcdf_fortran_4\&.4\&.2dev_notes_RW\&.pdf\fP\&. \fBIt is highly detailed and worth reading!\fP
.PP
The highlights of the improvements are as follows:

Explicit dependencies on \fCNC_MAX_DIM\fP constant for arrays has been removed and replaced with dynamically-allocated arrays\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Support for \fCnc_open_mem()\fP in the C library, allowing for the creation of 'in memory' files\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
Updated the \fCcfortran\&.doc\fP license document for the \fCcfortran\&.h\fP library\&. The most recent version was pulled from http://cfortran.sourceforge.net\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
Added a new variable for cmake-based builds, \fCNC_EXTRA_DEPS\fP\&. Use this to specify additional dependencies when linking against a static \fCnetcdf-c\fP library, e\&.g\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
For 32-bit platforms fixed integer fill parameters, initialized potentially unitialized variables, and provided some missing defaults (R\&. Weed)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fixed CMake builds on 32-bit platforms\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Added new \fCinq_path\fP and \fCrename_grps\fP functions analogous to corresponding C functions\&. Added associated tests (R\&. Weed)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Added support for NF_MPIIO, \fCNF_MPIPOSIX\fP, \fCNF_PNETCDF\fP flags and \fCNF_FILL_UINT\fP\&. (R\&. Weed)
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fixed potential bug in attribute functions for integer values when Fortran \fCINTEGER*1\fP or \fCINTEGER*2\fP types are the same size as C long (R\&. Weed)\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Added test for compiler support of Fortran 2008 \fCISO_FORTRAN_ENV\fP additions and TS29113 standard extension\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fixed \fCC_PTR_DIFF_T\fP issue reported by Orion Poplowski (R\&. Weed)\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
Added doxygen-generated documentation, using the \fC--enable-doxygen\fP and \fC-DENABLE_DOXYGEN\fP flags for autotools and cmake-based builds, respectively\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Added missing error codes for DAP and some netCDF-4 errors
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fixed some documentation for F77 API, added make rule for creating netcdf-f77 HTML files\&.

.IP "\(bu" 2
Moved to GitHub from Subversion, the location of the new GitHub repository is at: http://github.com/Unidata/netCDF-Fortran
.IP "\(bu" 2
Parallel-build portability fixes, particularly for OpenMPI and gcc/gfortran-4\&.8\&.x on the Mac\&. Also added test from Reto St√∂ckli for NCF-250 bug, demonstrating it was fixed in previous commit\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add support for NF_MPIIO, NF_MPIPOSIX, NF_PNETCDF, and NF_FILL_UINT in the data files\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add support for nf_inq_path\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Add a pre-processor macro that can be used to bypass the home-brew C_PTRDIFF_T definition and use the standard one for compilers that support it\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fix a potential bug in nf_attio to call the _long version of some puts/gets instead of the _int version\&. These were inside INT1_IS_C_LONG and INT2_IS_C_LONG ifdef blocks so they would have only showed up when those macros were true\&.

.SS "4\&.4-beta3 Released 2012-12-07"
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fixed bug that 'make -j check' fails, but 'make check' works fine\&.

Made handling of --disable-f03 more transparent\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Fixed adding flags for parallel I/O for MPI from David Warren\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Removed all the old C code that's not needed for this separate distribution\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Inadvertently broke the build until syncing with C distribution in later beta release\&.

\fCFortran 2003 Support\fP
.PP
Version 4\&.4 is the first release to support fortran 2003 and to use the ISO C Bindings available in fortran 2003 to replace the older C code wrappers\&.
.PP
Congratulations and thanks to Richard Weed at Mississippi State University, who is the author of new code\&.
.PP
See the file \fCREADME_F03_MODS\fP for a more complete description of the changes\&. Many changes to the build structure have been made at the same time as the new 2003 code has been inserted\&.
.PP
As part of the fortran 2003 refactor, the directory structure has been significantly modified\&. All the previous F90 C wrapper code has been moved to the 'libsrc' directory\&.
.PP
All of the fortran code has been moved to the 'fortran' directory\&. The directories names F77 and F90 have been removed\&. The most important consequence of this refactor is that pure Fortran77 compilers are no longer supported\&. It is assumed that the compiler supports at least Fortran 90 and also Fortran 77\&. If it also supports the ISO C Bindings, then the new 2003 code is used instead of the older C wrappers\&.
